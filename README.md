Ironclad Secure Vault Management System

📌 Project Overview

Ironclad Vault Management System is a secure, encrypted file storage and management application built using Spring Boot and Java.
The system allows users to upload, download, delete, and search files, with role-based access and audit logging for security and transparency.

Purpose
The primary goal is to create a centralized, secure vault system for storing sensitive files.
It ensures:
Data Security and Privacy: Encrypts files using AES-256 and stores user credentials securely with BCrypt hashing.
Controlled Access: Role-based access control ensures only authorized personnel can view, download, or delete files.
Accountability and Auditability: Maintains detailed audit logs of every file operation for transparency and traceability.
Ease of Use: Provides a simple interface for performing file operations with minimal technical complexity.
Ironclad Vault Management System is ideal for organizations, institutions, and individuals handling confidential documents like financial records, legal contracts, certificates, and personal data.
It exists in the real world as a solution for:
Secure storage of sensitive digital assets
Controlled access to confidential files
Transparent operational audit trails
Foundation for enterprise-grade document management systems

📈 Features

Secure file upload/download with AES encryption
JWT-based authentication and role management
Audit logging of all file actions
Search files by name
Role-based access control
User-friendly REST API design

🧠 How It Works (Internally)
User registers, password is hashed using BCrypt
User logs in, server issues a JWT token
User uploads/downloads files, JWT is validated by JwtRequestFilter
Each action is logged in AuditLog
Role-based security controls access to endpoints dynamically
